> Felt good about you till I didn't
> Sure-fire train wreck, omission
> Felt good about you
> Felt good about you

> Got what you demanded
> Picture perfect like you planned it
> Can't believe the way we landed
> Falling through
> Held my breath for your reaction
> Like the first time that we happened
> We were fighting more than laughing
> Black and blue

> Felt good about you till I didn't
> Bad nights, new girls, misgivings
> Felt good about you
> Felt good about you

> Got me where you want me
> In your palm, it's almost funny
> All my friends they tried to stop me
> Wanting you
> But I was never meant to listen
> Not until I found a reason
> It took all of me to walk away and choose
>
> Felt good about you
> You

> Felt good about you till I didn't
> You felt nice for a bad decision
> Felt good about you
> Felt good about you
>

> Future planning for no reason
> There were nights I skipped out sleeping 'cause of you
> I had less than half of something
> What you gave was what I wanted
