> I see the waves, I see an ocean there beneath your eyes
> And I wanna dive into the deep end
> I see the sun on the horizon of your orange sky
> And I'm getting warmer when you lean in
>
> It's like I'm walking on air tonight, you got me off the ground
> Now that I've been up this high, I ain't ever coming down
> Like I'm walking on air tonight, oh, above the clouds
> There's no words I can use to say it right
>
> Tell me can you feel it, the feeling, the way I do
> You hold me in your palms like I was made for you
> So tell me can you feel it, the feeling, the way I do
> I'll always remember when I fell into
> The feeling
>
>T he feeling
> Oh, the feeling
> The feeling
> Of, of you
>
> How can a heart be beating so hard for someone you don't know?
> But it feels like I've known you for a lifetime
> How can a touch say so much and cut right through my soul?
> You've got me spinning and I don't mind
>
