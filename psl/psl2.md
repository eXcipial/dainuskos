> "After Hours"
>
> We don't gotta take it slow
> I'ma hit the gas if you ready to go
> I wanna feel the sweat breathin' through your clothes
> The way you touch my neck got me ready to fold
>
> I wanna make magic (Magic)
> I want you to feel me (Feel me)
> I want you to grab it (Grab it)
> I want you to steal me (Steal me)
> If you want it, you can have it (Have it)
> I want you to free me (Free me)
> I'm not tryin' to lock you down
>
> You came in on your own (Own), own (Own), own (Own)
> Caught up in your zone (Zone), zone (Zone), zone (Zone, zone)
> In a room full of strangers, different faces (Yeah)
> It feels like we're alone ('Lone), alone ('Lone), alone
>
> Why don't you stay?
> Stay here after hours
> I know you don't wanna leave (Don't wanna leave)
> Stay here after hours
> After hours, we can—
> 
> We ain't gotta check the time
> Even when it ends, it's still you and I
> We ain't even know they turned on the lights
> We missed the last call, ridin' on a high (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
>
> It's more than a moment (Moment)
> This can't be a memory (Memory)
> The party is over (Over)
> You wanna come with me? (With me)
> My home never closes (Closes)
> Just want you to feel free (Feel free)
> I'm not tryin' to lock you down
>
> You came in on your own (Own), own (Own), own (Own)
> Caught up in your zone (Zone), zone (Zone), zone (Zone, zone)
> In a room full of strangers, different faces (Yeah)
> It feels like we're alone ('Lone), alone ('Lone), alone
